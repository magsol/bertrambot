*A StarCraft II Bot*

## Overview

This was inspired by [sentdex's recent YouTube series on creating StarCraft II bots](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcT3tPehHdisGMc8TInNqdq) using Python. Given the history of this repository, it's something I've been wanting to do for awhile.

## Prerequisites

 - Python (3.6, _not_ 3.7)
 - [python-sc2](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2) (though take note of [sentdex's fork](https://github.com/daniel-kukiela/python-sc2/commit/615ad809306e6f6cd6410990c3c7228db5ffd900) that includes an `on_end` method for capturing the final result)
