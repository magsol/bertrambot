*A StarCraft: Brood War bot.*

Version History
---------------
v0.01 (March 3, 2011)
  - Mostly setup, with the example AI module that was modified committed.
  - Finished getting Brood War/Chaoslauncher/BWAPI to communicate with each other. See results/notes/thoughts posted on the [project wiki](http://www.magsol.me/wiki/index.php5?title=2011-03-05).
  - Committed code is the ExampleAIModule that is included with the BWAPI release, but it was slightly modified as a proof-of-concept injection code. Modifications include different messages, and an attack trigger (see onReceiveText).

v0.0
  - Just setting up the repository and committing the BWAPI modules.
